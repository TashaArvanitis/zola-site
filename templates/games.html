    <p>NOTE: using things for free on the internet is all fun and games until
    it means game designers and programmers aren't getting fairly
    compensated for their work. I recommend:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Owning these games before playing them online â€“ this option is like
        bringing the physical game to a party. It means you're paying the
        designer a fair price. But it still doesn't thank the people who
        implement the game somewhere on a website.</li>
    <li>Tip, donate, or buy a coffee for the web developers who put your
        favorite games online. Even just a $5-10 contribution helps.</li>
    <li>In addition to (1) and/or (2), send designers a thank you email!
        They'll certainly appreciate it.</li>
    </ol>
