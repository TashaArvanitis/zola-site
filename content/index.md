Hi! I'm Zeph, a scientist, teammate, and adventurer. I make sense of the
world by asking lots and lots of questions. More broadly, I love to learn
new things, partly because the experience of confusion about a topic is
fun, and partly because the moment when things click together and finally
make sense is simply amazing. Nothing gets me more excited than building a
mental model to understand (and often solve) a complex problem.

Over the years, my online presence has migrated around various sites
and forms. This is my new (2021) attempt to bring all these things back
under one roof.

  * WordPress
  * most recently, zola (a Rust-powered static site generator)
