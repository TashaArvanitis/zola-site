title = "Grace Hopper!"

I’m excited to share that I’ll be speaking at the Grace Hopper Celebration
of Women in Computer Science this week in Houston, TX. My presentation,
titled "Accurate Physics-Based Models for Biomolecular Simulations," will
be on Thursday morning at 9am. I’ll be discussing the application of some
cool data science techniques to molecular modeling, including how physical
and chemical intuition can inform our data analysis, and how data science
can actually provide us with new insights into the underlying physics. Hope
to see you there!

## EDIT (After GHC)

Thanks to everyone who came out and saw my talk, and for all the great
questions afterwards! I had a ton of fun and learned a bunch at Grace
Hopper, and am so glad to have made it out to glorious Houston.

A few highlights:

* Hearing about how data and analysis thereof can drive social change from
Latanya Sweeny.
* Meeting Megan Smith, CTO of the United States (who knew we had a CTO, and
that she is so awesome?!)
* Hearing more about how one can contribute to open source, and how to find
projects open to being helped.
* Watching the wonderful Prof. Lewis accept an ABIE award (congrats!) and
talk about how she navigated failure as an undergraduate.
* Learning about some new ed-tech applications that are working to change how
education is done in the 21st century.
* Exploring the career fair, which was as always packed with companies who
are not only welcoming but inviting and embracing diversity in all forms.

I came away inspired and ready to work towards increasing diversity in
tech! Let’s do this thing.
