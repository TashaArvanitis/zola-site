Alright, today was day 1 of our training program! For today, we largely focused on logistical tips and tricks. On the whole, I'm happy to be in absorbing-knowledge mode again! One key thing we learned was tying kayaks down to affix them to a trailer. To do so, we use a "three loop two half hitch" approach to cinch kayaks down. At least in theory, that should prevent them from going on any unintended flights or tumbles. It took three round trips to get all our kayaks out of storage, so I think we can all tie them down by now. Hooray!
