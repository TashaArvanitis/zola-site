Once upon a time, almost 14 billion years ago, there was a Big Bang. In the
milliseconds afterwards, everything in the Universe (mostly electrons,
positrons, photons, and neutrinos) was in thermal equilibrium. What that
means is that the reaction
$$
\nu+\overline{\nu}\leftrightarrow e^+ + e^-
$$
could occur in both directions. That means the energy of the neutrinos has
to be high enough to produce two more massive particles, and the cross
section for the interaction has to do with the temperature of the Universe.
At a temperature of around $10^{10}$ K, the temperature of the Universe
dropped below the critical temperature for the reaction shown above to
proceed in both directions, so neutrinos could fly free through the
Universe without having to worry about interacting with much else.
These neutrinos play a role in things like the ratio of protons to neutrons
and the frequency components of the cosmic microwave background, and we
believe that they are still around to this day. They're called the cosmic
neutrino background. While general relativity is needed to understand the
time evolution of the neutrino background, essentially what happens is that
the neutrinos cool as the Universe expands. Theorists predict the current
energy of the neutrinos in this background to be around $10^{-4}$ eV. To
fully appreciate how cold these guys are, let's take another look at our
favorite neutrino-related graph, the one showing flux vs. energy of
neutrinos produced in hydrogen fusion.

Note that the neutrinos we were so excited to detect with gallium detectors
have energies around 0.3 mega electron volts. So the detection of the
cosmic neutrino background is, for the time being, an insurmountable
experimental challenge.

Even though we can't directly see the neutrino background, we have some
good reasons to believe that it exists. For one thing, the presence of
neutrinos affects the ratio of protons to neutrons, based on reactions like
the following:
$$
n\leftrightarrow p+e^-+\overline\nu_e\\\\
$$
$$
p+e^-\leftrightarrow n + \nu_e
$$
As such, the presence of neutrinos throughout the Universe has dramatic
effects on nucleosynthesis, the process by which nucleons combine into
larger nuclei, and the current abundances give indirect evidence for the
cosmic neutrino background.
For another thing, apparently the angular frequency components of the
cosmic microwave background's temperature fluctuations are "damped"
relative to predictions in the absence of the neutrino background. I
believe that has to do with the way in which vibrations propagate through
the very early Universe. Neutrinos provided a certain amount of diffusion,
which served to make the Universe more isotropic than it would have been in
their absence.

Why do we care about this? We know very little about the early stages of
the Universe's evolution. Some of our most useful information comes from
observations of the cosmic microwave background, which decoupled from the
rest of matter when the Universe was around 300 years old. The neutrino
background, if detected, can tell us quite a bit about the intervening time
period, which gets us that much closer to understanding the highest-energy
event in the history of the Universe.
