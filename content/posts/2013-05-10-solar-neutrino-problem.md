The neutrino detectors discussed in the last post are all well and good,
but there's a bit of a problem, and it's substantial enough to have earned
itself a catchy name: the solar neutrino problem.

See, the theory of
electroweak interactions and astrophysical models of the Sun makes fairly
precise predictions about the fluxes of neutrinos that should be measured
by these various detectors. But when the detectors go and look for these
neutrinos, they find substantially fewer - around a third to a half as many
as theorists predicted. This is true all across the board, from the
chemical to the Cerenkov detectors, and caused physicists quite the
headache.

From Bahcall, Solar Neutrinos.
Initially, it seemed like this was bad news for us. Neutrinos come to us
straight from the center of the sun, as opposed to photons, which take
thousands to tens of thousands of years to bounce their way out of the
center, so it seemed possible that the lack of neutrinos meant that against
all odds, the sun's fusion was dying!

Luckily, SNO came to the rescue. As you can see at the right of the image
above, the electron-neutrino reaction monitored by SNO, like all the other
detectors, finds less than 30% as many neutrinos as expected. But, when we
look at the other reaction, the one insensitive to neutrino flavor, we find
around 90% of the expected flux, within uncertainties. So it seems that
somehow the neutrinos produced in the center of the Sun, which are all
electron neutrinos, somehow morph into other types as they travel to us.
This phenomenon is called neutrino oscillations, and will be discussed
briefly in the near future.

This is the third post in a series on neutrino astrophysics.
