title = "Betelgeuse"

Rather than a general physics fact, I thought it'd be fun to share a few
facts about a star familiar to many stargazers: Betelgeuse, the left
shoulder of Orion (you know, the guy with the belt).  If it were in our
solar system centered at the Sun, its boundary would extend well past the
orbit of Mars - that's one big star. It's a supergiant, which means that
its surface is cooler than smaller stars like the sun. So it appears
noticeably red, even for stargazers in the light-pollution capital of the
world, Los Angeles.

To complicate matters, it seems that Betelgeuse also grows and shrinks
periodically, and experiences corresponding changes in brightness and
color. And all of this is hard to see, because it's surrounded by a very
strangely-shaped cloud (remember the interstellar medium?), which
interferes with observations. Experimentalists are really impressive!
