This summer I was lucky enough to attend FemEx 2017 in the Netherlands.
FemEx is a conference promoing female excellence in computational and
theoretical chemistry, so it was right up my scientific alley! Add to that
the fact that I've been studying Dutch for almost two years now, and it
made this conference a perfect fit for me.

With the help of my manager and advisor at work, I put together a poster on
some of my recent research, which I was able to present at the conference.
I got a bunch of interesting questions and suggestions, and as always,
explaining my work helped me understand it better than before.

It was, predictably, an amazing experience. I met a ton of amazing female
powerhouses in chemistry (and a few men too), discussed science and life in
general with fellow attendees, and generally learned a ton in a very short
period of time.

A few highlights:

* Several people are doing intriguing work on reactive force fields,
including work from the ReaxFF team (presented by Dr. Ole Carstensen) to
improve parametrization for reaction rates and a fascinating force
field called LEWIS (presented by Dr. Judith Hertzfeld) that features
explicit electron pairs and replicate qualitative geometric features of
several types of molecules
* There was some interesting work on meso-scale modeling using a finite
elements approach presented by Dr. Sarah Harris, whose lab has just
released an open source project for said models at
[ffea.bitbucket.io](http://ffea.bitbucket.io).
* Dr. Rosa Bulo presented on work with QM/MM and energy conservation - in
particular she's found that a good force field for the MM component is
critical to preventing depletion in the region where interactions
transition from QM to MM.
* One talk discussed how stretching bonds to breaking point affects their
ability to form hydrogen bonds. Dr. Katarzyna Pernal showed that electron
rearrangements that result from stretching a bond briefly strengthen van
der Waals interactions, which is a somewhat counterintuitive result.
* DNA repair seemed to be a secret theme of the conference: no fewer than
three talks were presented on work studying various DNA repair mechanisms,
ranging from QM/MM (a method that blends quantum mechanical calculation
with faster molecular mechanics outside the region of interest, presented
by Dr. Shirin Faraji) to plain molecular mechanics on tandem lesions
(presented by Dr. Elise Dumont) to simulated infrared spectroscopy
(presented by Ana Cunha).
* Finally, I was incredibly honored to win a prize based on the poster and
my presentation thereof. Thank you very much to the International Journal
of Quantum Chemistry and Journal of Computational Chemistry for sponsoring
the prize, and to the judges at FemEx for choosing me!

On the whole, I met an inspiring group of chemists and look forward to
following their work in the future. Together we can change gender biases
and increase the proportion of historically underrepresented minorities in
science!
