I'm particularly excited to improve my technical paddling skills this summer. Between interesting currents and a variety of weather conditions, there's certainly plenty of opportunity to paddle in varied conditions. On top of that, we have two incredible coaches who work for AKT and who have been extremely generous with their time.

I've mentioned before that I [panic underwater in a
kayak](@/posts/2018-05-03-drysuits-bow-rescue.md). Last season in Seward, I
gradually improved my confidence at a smooth wet exit, but that's about
where my efforts ended. I confessed this fact to these coaches and Erik,
and mentioned my interest in mastering a roll. They've been super
supportive.

Our first day of training, Erik suggested something that sounded ridiculous at first: wear a snorkeling mask while working on wet exits. I couldn't see how this would help, but I went along with it. I was stunned by the result. I carefully composed myself and then rolled over, prepared for the usual wave of panic. And nothing happened. I was upside down underwater, with a great view of the front of my boat and no water up my nose, and for the first time ever, I felt like I could still think. I did several wet exits and grew in confidence each time. And it felt awesome! From there, I practiced closing my eyes, then finally graduated to no mask. The familiar wave of panic is still there, but it seems content to wait in the background.

This is going to be an ongoing struggle, but for now I've found another tool to help build my confidence, and I'm excited to keep working on it!
