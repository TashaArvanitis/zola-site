QGIS has a multitude of amazing, community-supported plugins for almost any purpose. Today I'll talk you through how to install a QGIS plugin, Magnetic Declination. To use it for the first time, check out [Add a compass rose](https://heytasha.com/questions/2020/08/compass-magnetic-declination/) here.

While you're here, I recommend installing QuickMapServices as well; it's super handy.
