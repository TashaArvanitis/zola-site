A few days ago, I spotted a spinet piano on someone's curb. I thought "huh, do I know anyone who needs a piano?" but couldn't come up with a friend in need, so I left it. But it was still there as I walked by it one afternoon. I thought I should at least try to play it. It was in pretty bad shape: dramatically out of tune in the high and low ranges, chipped keys, and generally in a state of disrepair. I peeked under the lid, plunked on some keys, and realized I don't really know how pianos work. Thus was a strange idea born: take this piano home, take it apart, and see how its various parts work together.

### How does a piano weigh so much?!

I'm used to maneuvering a spinet piano from volunteering on sound at English dances. In my head, it's a job easily done by one person, thanks to the piano's wheels. So when I decided to take the piano home (a matter of a couple of blocks), I figured moving it would be tricky but not a huge deal. Then I tried to lift one end. Oof, was it heavy!

It turns out that in order to support the tension required in all those tuned strings, you have to make the frame out of cast iron. Plus there tends to be heavy wood on the outside for longevity, and each key needs its own mechanism. It all adds up, and a typical spinet piano weighs in at upwards of 300 pounds.

### How can I move a piano?

As I mentioned, this piano was only a few blocks away from home when I spotted it on the curb. I fetched a hand truck and came back out, ready to roll. (See what I did there?) But of course I couldn't really get the hand truck under the piano, and even when I could, I certainly couldn't lift it up. I spent around half an hour zig-zagging it onto the street and making my way to the corner. At that point, a tremendously kind neighbor stepped in. Half an hour and several minor blisters and near-tips later, the piano arrived at its final destination. Thanks friendly neighbor!

Note: in general it's a bad idea to use the tiny wheels on the bottom of the piano for long-distance transportation. If you have a piano that's worth actual money, piano movers recommend using specialized wheels for the purpose.

### Getting to know my new piano

One of the first things I did once I finally got it home and moved it into the garage was figure out a little about its background. It's a Wurlitzer, and based on its serial number, it was made between 1955 and 1960.

Next up, of course, was naming the piano. I picked Spinny, given it's a spinet. I'll be using it/its pronouns here, because overly personifying an object I'm taking apart feels weird.

### How do I take apart a piano?

Some questions I wanted to figure out:

- What are the acoustic properties of the piano?
- Can I tune it a little better?
- Can I get one key's mechanism as a standalone setup?
- What parts are inside the piano, anyway?
- Can I put it back together?
- Can I repurpose portions of the piano for other uses?
