Recently, getting restless thanks to the gorgeous weather and the constant
hustle and bustle of living in New York City, I decided it was time to head
into the woods for a night. After a bit of research, I settled on Harriman
State Park as a destination: it’s relatively accessible via public transit
but far enough from the city to feel like a different world.

I executed this in the middle of the week, which I maintain was an
excellent choice. Pros: fewer people, a bit more peaceful. Cons: paying
peak prices on the Metro North, having relatively little time on either end
of sleeping out in the woods. All this is dwarfed, though, by the biggest
pro of all: a peaceful night of sleep out in the open, away from the sound
of sirens and car horns.

I took the Metro North to Harriman, then hopped in a taxi to get to the
Island Pond entrance. From there, it’s a short hop to the Appalachian
Trail, so I hiked a ways down that way before setting up camp. Yes, I
hammock camp. Yes, it’s wonderful. There’s not too much more to say, other
than that I spent several delightfully relaxing hours reading by lantern
light in the wonderful warm of my hammock plus underquilt. It dropped to
right around 50 F overnight, and I was warm all night long. The next
morning, I slept in until around 7:30 (funny how my standards for “sleeping
in” change between the city and the forest), explored a tad, packed up, and
headed back to Harriman to get back into the city for work. It was a
fabulous trip, and I will certainly be doing something like it again in the
future.

Next time I head out there, I’ll do a couple things differently:

* Take my bike on the train with me, to avoid taxi expenses, which more than
doubled the cost of the trip. ($31 gets me round-trip fare from Penn
Station to Harriman, and I paid a total of $35-40 for the very short taxi
rides.)
* Head out around a full moon, to provide a little plausible deniability for
the amount of light pollution.
* Get to sleep a little earlier so that I have more time to enjoy the
daylight in the morning.
