This week I had the tremendous pleasure of accepting my first outdoor industry job: during summer 2018 I will be guiding kayak tours with [Kayak Adventures Worldwide](http://www.kayakak.com/) in Seward, Alaska. This company has a fabulous training program and a tight-knit community. On top of that, Seward is one of the most spectacular places I've ever seen. I couldn't be more excited. Here's how I went from "it might be fun to work outdoors?" to "heck yeah I'm going to work outdoors!"

### Learning the ropes

My first serious conversation about what it takes to work in the outdoors was
over the summer last year, when I sat down with two fabulous kayak guides in
Alaska and absorbed a ton of wisdom from them. It was from these two amazing
women that I learned what outdoor industry jobs tend to entail, when and where
to start looking for them, and what's important in an application. Most
significantly, they emphasized the importance of a wilderness first responder
(WFR) certification. I took my WFR course in October through NOLS and it was an
absolute blast. I wrote about it on an [older
blog (now updated to be here too!)](@/posts/2017-11-02-wilderness-first-response.md)
if you want to hear more about it.

At that point, I started mentioning my harebrained work-in-the-outdoors plan to friends and family. Almost everyone I spoke with had a friend or two who'd done something similar. Many people were kind enough to introduce me to their outdoorsy friend(s), and I started hearing stories and advice about outdoor industry jobs.

Based on many such discussions, I decided I had four requirements for my foray into the outdoors. I wanted to be:

1. In the United States. No visas for me, thanks!
2. Outdoors. Let's cancel out some of that hyper-dense NYC living, shall we?
3. Active. There are jobs out there that involve being outdoors but are primarily centered on guiding from a bus or a plane. These sound wonderful but aren't what I was looking for.
4. Working with people. I learned a ton from my stint at trail building, but I ended up really craving interactions with people. I want to share my wonder at the outdoors with others, not just make it easier for people to get from point A to B.

### Finding outdoor industry jobs

I mostly found positions through the [NOLS Jobsnetwork](https://jobsnetwork.nols.edu/), which is a treasure trove of outdoor industry jobs. It's free to NOLS alumni, though I've heard that non-alums can also access it. Using their handy filters, I was able to find a variety of positions that looked good to me. I ended up primarily looking at guiding, summer camps, and wilderness therapy.

Word of mouth also worked well for me, whether in conversations with friends of friends or on a shadow day with an amazing ski patrol team.

### Applying

Over the course of about a month (late December to early February), I applied to:

- Two summer camps: one as an instructor/counselor and one as a leader for a five-week road trip with amazing camping and hiking and adventuring along the way.
- Outward Bound in the Northwest
- Two kayak guiding positions: one in Alaska and one in the San Juan Islands

I was also planning to apply to a bunch of others (you should have seen my browser tabs), but ended up getting an awesome offer before I got the chance.

For the places I applied, applications were due anytime between late December and mid-February, with many more falling later. In general, guiding jobs seemed to have earlier applications, while wilderness therapy and summer camps are much more spread out. The typical application process included a resume, some sort of cover letter or long-form answers to specific questions, a 30-45 minute interview over Skype/Google Hangouts, and reference contacts. The ordering of references vs interview was inconsistent, and next time I plan to be a little more upfront with my references about what I know and where I've applied.

### Success!

In the end, I got 2.5 job offers, one rejection, and I retracted one application when I accepted my job with KAW. I learned a lot about working in the outdoors through the process, and more importantly I got to know many inspiring outdoorspeople. None of this adventure would have been possible without the support of friends, family, and coworkers. Thank you all for believing in me.
