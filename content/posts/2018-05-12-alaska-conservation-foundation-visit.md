At Kayak Adventures, we are proud members of [One Percent for the Planet](https://www.onepercentfortheplanet.org/). That means we donate 1% of our annual sales to environmental groups in our area. To be clear, that's sales, not profits, which is a pretty big deal. Regardless of whether we actually make money, we donate 1% of the money guests pay us to Alaskan foundations. We have three that guests can choose between, and today we were able to visit one of them: the Alaska Conservation Foundation (ACF).

#### What is the Alaska Conservation Foundation?

If I had to give an elevator (van-on-Lowell-Point-Road) pitch about the Alaska Conservation Foundation, it would be something like this:

> The ACF is an umbrella organization. It collects and distributes funds to conservation hotspots throughout the state. This includes a focus on information and education, as well as intentional conservation collaboration. One of their biggest campaigns is their opposition to the Pebble Mine, which jeopardizes the health of the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world. In addition, they're working with Native organizations, rural populations, and local groups to build climate change resilience in a tough time for conservation.

It was lovely to meet with this great organization and hear about their operations. I look forward to discussing them with guests throughout the summer!
