This is the first in a series of posts about neutrinos and astrophysics.
Other neutrino-related posts can be found [here](/tags/neutrinos).

At first, neutrinos seem like puzzling particles; they interact only by the
weak force, carry almost no mass, and seem insignificant to the grand
scheme of things. On the contrary, they've played a fundamental role in the
evolution of the Universe, and are a uniquely powerful tool in our
understanding of certain astrophysical phenomena. This is precisely because
of their low interaction rates; they can propagate effortlessly through
optically thick material and bring us information that light cannot.

As you may know, there are three types of neutrinos, the electron, muon,
and tau flavors, which correspond to specific leptons. There are a variety
of neutrino sources. The nearest and most accessible is the Sun, which
sends neutrinos to us at a rate of around a billion per square centimeter
per second. Then there are energetic events like supernovae and gamma ray
bursts, which provide short-lived fluxes of neutrinos. There's also this
thing called the cosmic neutrino background, which is analogous to the
cosmic microwave background. Finally, there are atmospheric neutrinos,
which are produced by cosmic ray interactions with the atmosphere.

In order to discuss neutrino detection, it is beneficial to examine the
largest source of neutrinos in our neighborhood: fusion in the center of
the Sun (discussed in much greater depth in the post [here](@/posts/2013-03-07-fusion.md)). The plot below
shows the neutrino flux as a function of its energy as a result of various
steps in hydrogen fusion.

The solid lines show neutrino fluxes versus the energy of the produced
neutrinos for various steps in the proton proton chain. In particular, the
lowest-energy neutrinos shown (the spike on the left) are produced in the
first step of the pp chain, while the other reactions, like boron-8 and
He-p fusion, occur in only a small fraction of solar fusion reactions. The
dashed lines show predicted neutrino fluxes from the CNO cycle, which isn't
terribly relevant to the Sun, since its core is too cool for the CNO cycle
to function.
