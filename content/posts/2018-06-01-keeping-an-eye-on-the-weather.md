In a [previous post](https://heytasha.com/questions/2018/05/ending-a-trip-early/), I discussed how I made my first weather call. One of my conclusions then was that I should do a better job of paying attention to the weather and how it's changing around me. One of the things I love most about this area is how it's constantly changing. But that can also be hard to manage, when changes in wind and waves can make paddling dangerous in a matter of hours.
