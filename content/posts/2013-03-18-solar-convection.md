It's been a while, but here's a new fun physics fact!

The two main means of heat dissipation in stars are radiation, in which
light transfers energy away from the center of the star, and convection, in
which hotter areas of the star bubble upward, carrying their heat with them
and expanding as they rise.

Convection is a much more effective means of heat transfer than radiation,
but only kicks in when the stellar temperature decreases outwards with
radius more slowly than the convective bubble's temperature as it moves
outward (this means that if a bubble of hotter material rises a bit, when
it expands and cools, it remains hotter than its surroundings - if it
didn't, it would just sink again, and convection wouldn't occur). In this
case, convection carries heat outward very quickly, drowning out radiative
heat transfer.

Convection occurs in the outer 30% or so of the Sun, and is visible on the
surface of the sun as granules (around the size of North America) of
bright, hot material rising to the surface surrounded by boundaries of
darker, cooler material sinking downward.

Also, according to Wikipedia, just below the surface of the sun are
supergranules - convective regions that are larger than the entire Earth!
