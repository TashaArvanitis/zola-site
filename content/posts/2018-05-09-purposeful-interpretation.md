A few days ago, we started to discuss purposeful interpretation. This is crucial to our job as kayak guides: interpretation is how we share this area with guests and shape their experience here.

Interpretation means different things to different people. One definition I really like is from the National Association for Interpretation: "interpretation is a mission-based communication process that forges emotional and intellectual connections between the interests of the audience and the meanings inherent in the resource." See, our job isn't about teaching. It's about creating connection, about leaving guests with an emotional response to this place. And just like with public speaking, there are techniques you can use to make that happen.

#### The TORE model of purposeful interpretation

Following in the footsteps of Sam Ham, the father of thematic interpretation, we use the TORE model. In order:

- Theme: have a theme. That's a major point you want to make, overriding conclusion the audience can draw, or a general unifying thread connecting all your interp. A strong theme will inspire curiosity and generally cause people to think.
- Organized: keep your information organized and easy to follow. There's lots of ways to organize a trip's interp. Perhaps you base it on your route, or go from the big picture to beautiful details. At the core of it, this means you have a very strong grasp on the material you discuss, or you _will_ end up being scattered in your delivery.
- Relevant: to be relevant to an adult audience, interpretation has to be both meaningful and personal. Meaning refers to connections to existing knowledge and interest. We can help create meaning by using examples or metaphors, or by comparing to things people already know. When interp is personal, it connects to "universal concepts" like strong emotions, basic needs, or our fascination with uncertainty.
- Enjoyable: make your interp interesting to your audience! Use humor and lead discovery, rather than regurgitating many facts.

Tons of thanks to Trent for teaching us about interp. Thanks also to all my fellow guides for modeling it and giving constant feedback.

I'm working now on using a central theme to organize my information. Keep an eye out for some "glacier talks" as I try out some themes in the next few days!
