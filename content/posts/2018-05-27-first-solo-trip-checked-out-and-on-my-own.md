I have exciting news: I'm now allowed to run trips on my own! I [checked
out](@/posts/2018-05-25-first-trip-as-a-lead-guide.md) over the past two
days, so I can lead trips in both Resurrection and Aialik Bays. This
evening was my first solo trip as a lead guide, and it was pretty
interesting. In particular, we didn't end up seeing much wildlife, but
people still had an awesome time. We chatted about the history of the area,
exchanged stories of heroism (that serum run to Nome in 1925), and
generally soaked up the scenery. It's so cool to have the flexibility to
really make a trip fit the people going on it, rather than forcing everyone
into the same mold. On the whole, it was a great first solo trip! I look
forward to continuing to learn from every trip I lead.

In some free time today, I also got to go on my first personal (non-trip)
paddle. Alex and I headed out to practice navigating around Tonsina, which
we first learned about in
[training](@/posts/2018-05-08-kayaking-day-trip-caines-head.md). It was
great to have another go at it, and I feel much more comfortable navigating
it now. Hooray! It was also just the perfect day to be out on the water, so
I'm glad to have made it out.
