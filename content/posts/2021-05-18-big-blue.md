Recently heard the song "Ode to Big Blue" at a singing circle, and I made a
couple tweaks to increase its factual accuracy.

**Ode to Big Blue** (but with whale facts)

The oceans of the world were the home of Big Blue  
She was the greatest mammal that the world ever knew  
And the place that she loved best --- was the waters to the west  
Around the blue Pacific she did roam  

Big Blue moved alone, for a mighty blue was she  
But her kindness with her calf was an awesome sight to see  
She took that Little Blue and she taught them all she knew  
In the making of the future she was queen  

Big Blue had fifteen calves and sure, some of ‘em were sons  
Though most of them fell victim to the cruel harpoon guns  
Ah but she was too much wise to get caught by the gunners’ eyes  
And so she lived at sea for eighty years  

Now the gray whale had run and the sperm was almost done  
The finbacks and the Greenland Rights had all but passed and gone  
They were taken by the men for the money they could spend  
We said “the killing never ends, it just goes on”  

Technology’s a toss-up for our tale of Big Blue  
Harpoon guns as a slaughter tool were altogether new  
But at last cheap turpentine led to whaling’s long decline  
A victory of progress for Big Blue  

Big Blue passed away to her natural decay  
Beside the Arctic Circle as she travelled up that way  
She sank slow as can be to the bottom of the sea  
For years she fueled an ecosystem there  

The oceans of the world were the home of Big Blue  
She was the greatest creature that the world ever knew  
And the place that she loved best --- was the waters to the west  
Around the blue Pacific she did roam  

### Fun whale facts
  * Blue whales aren't just the largest creature on Earth at the moment
      – they're the largest ever to grace our planet.
  * As for most whale species, blue whale females are larger than their
      male counterparts. Thus the transformation from he/him to she/her
      pronouns throughout
  * A typical female blue whale might have a calf every two or three years,
      feeding the young ones something like 200 *kilograms* of milk (with
      40% milk fat!) per day for about eight months.
  * When a whale dies, it usually floats at the surface for a short time,
      then sinks to the bottom of the ocean. These whale falls are an
      incredible infusion of nutients into deep-ocean environments (some
      estimates suggest 100-200 times the annual nutrient infusion in the
      area they land), and can fuel thriving ecosystems for literal
      decades. In fact, enough whales sink to the ocean floor along
      whale migration routes that it's likely whale-fall-specialist
      organisms can migrate from whale fall to whale fall, allowing
      evolution of highly specific and altogether bizarre species.
  * I always thought whaling faded from favor because of environmental
      activism and new international laws. But in fact, the near-extinction
      of most species and the invention of cheaper sources of oil like
      coal oil and (to a lesser extent but better for rhyming) played a
      much larger role.
