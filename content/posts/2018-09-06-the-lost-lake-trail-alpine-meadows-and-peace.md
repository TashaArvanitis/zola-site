On one of my recent days off, I had the enormous pleasure of hiking the Lost Lake-Primrose connection. It's a 15-mile trail near Seward. It's a thru-hike, which means that you start at a different spot than you end, which can require some logistical finesse. But it is also one of the most beautiful hikes I've ever encountered. I highly recommend the Lost Lake trail for anyone with the time and ability to try it out.

Here are some of my favorite moments!

#### Setting a high bar for hitchhiking

Once I exited the Lost Lake trail on the south end, I had to find myself a ride back home. I walked the mile or so back to the Seward Highway and started walking south, putting up a thumb when cars whizzed by. After not very long, a lovely driver stopped for me and offered me a ride into town. She was heading to Seward to pick up some processed fish after a successful fishing trip that morning, and I helped her pick up her load. Then she was kind enough to drop me off right in front of the shop, and even gave me a fresh salmon filet! Not bad for a first hitchhiking experience.
