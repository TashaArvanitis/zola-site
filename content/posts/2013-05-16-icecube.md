Well, I thought I was done with neutrino astrophysics yesterday, but then I
read about the recent discovery of two extremely high-energy neutrinos by
the IceCube collaboration.

As I've mentioned before, IceCube is a Cerenkov
detector. Its 'detector' consists of about a cubic kilometer of ice in the
Antarctic, and it has 86 strings of detectors suspended in the ice. They
typically detect solar and atmospheric neutrinos, but in an article
submitted to Phys. Rev. Letters last month, they report the detection of
two peta-electron volt neutrinos. That's $10^{15}$ electron volts! These
high-energy events are very unlikely to have resulted from cosmic ray
interactions with the atmosphere (though the collaboration is investigating
the possibility that they resulted from the decay of charmed particles
produced by high-energy cosmics), and the collaboration is fairly sure that
they're actually a product of some extremely high-energy astrophysical
events. In the paper, they suggest gamma ray bursts or active galactic
nuclei as potential sources, and they're hopeful that further analysis will
reveal more similarly energetic neutrinos or give clues to their origin.

Oh, and just as proof that physicists have a sense of humor, the detected
neutrinos have been named Bert and Ernie. It's even in the graphics for the
paper!

The above graphic (taken from the paper) provides a visualization of the
events in question. Each sphere shows the data from one photomultiplier
tube embedded in the ice. The size of the sphere shows how many
photoelectrons were detected, and the color shows the time at which the
detection occurred, from red for the first detections to blue for the last.
The energy of the event can be determined from the total number of
photoelectrons detected, and the collaboration calculated energies of 1.04
and 1.14 PeV for Bert and Ernie, respectively.

For those interested, the paper in question can be found here.
