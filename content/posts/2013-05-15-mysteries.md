As you've probably guessed by now, there's a lot we don't know about
neutrinos and how they function in astrophysics. They have a lot of
mysteries in store for us. Here are a few:

* Value of $\theta_{13}$ and the neutrino mass hierarchy. Remember the mixing
angles from the discussion of neutrino oscillations? Well, we know two of
them fairly well, including their signs, but we have very little
information on $\theta_{13}$. This is particularly interesting because the
sign of that particular mixing angle will tell us how the masses of the
mass eigenstates are related. There are two possibilities: the natural mass
hierarchy, in which $m_{\nu_1}&lt;m_{\nu_2}&lt;m_{\nu_3}$ (shown at left below),
and the inverted mass hierarchy, in which $m_{\nu_3}&lt;m_{\nu_1}&lt;m_{\nu_2}$
(shown at right below).

* Dirac/Majorana neutrinos. There is a bit of an outstanding question on
whether the neutrino has a distinct antiparticle (Dirac neutrino) or is its
own antiparticle (Majorana neutrino). If it is a Majorana particle, then
processes such as neutrinoless double-beta decay could occur, in which two
neutrinos annihilate in joint beta decay of two neutrons. This is a highly
sought-after reaction, and there are legions of physicists working to find
or rule out such a reaction.

* Other neutrino sources. We've spotted neutrinos from a supernova before,
but we should also be able to detect some from other astrophysical sources,
like active galactic nuclei (really bright spots caused by accretion around
a supermassive black hole) and gamma ray bursts (possibly bright bursts
from rapidly rotating supernovae - is physics awesome, or what?). Detecting
neutrinos from such events may help us understand what's going on in
high-energy events.
In summary, neutrinos are pretty awesome little particles. They can be
useful in understanding phenomena that light can't easily bring us
information about, and they have a lot of mysteries left for us to sort
out.
