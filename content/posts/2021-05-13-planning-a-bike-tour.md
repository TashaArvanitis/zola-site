I'm planning a bike tour from the Chicago area out west to Washington
state. What's involved? What does it look like? How do you even start?

<!-- more -->

You may recall way back before Covid that I was planning a several-week
[paddle up the Inside Passage](@/posts/2020-02-20-paddling-the-inside-passage.md).
Unsurprisingly, that didn't happen. But ever since then I've been eager for
a longer outdoor trip covering some real distance. Now cases are declining
and I'm fully vaccinated, so the time is right.

## Why?
This serves two purposes for me – space for introspection and rejuvenation,
and bringing me to Washington state, where I'll be living for a bit.

Relatedly, why biking? Well, it is a bit more approachable at the moment
than paddling, and doesn't require any international border crossings. It
also allows me to stay within easy reach of civilization and safely on
land, which makes me much more comfortable with adventuring solo than I am
with solo paddling. (Fun fact: when biking, if you need a break, it is almost
always easy to find someplace to eat a snack or take a nap with minimal risk
of drowning or getting crushed against sharp rocks by the ocean.)

## Route
I'll be mostly following [Adventure Cycling's](http://adventurecycling.org)
Northern Tier route. That means going IL to IA to MN to ND to MT to ID to
WA. For me, following an existing route reduces navigation-related risks.
Plus it's probably saved me dozens of hours in Google streetview, and I
trust Adventure Cycling to keep me off the worst highways.

In total, the route is approximately 2600-2700 miles, with fairly
substantial elevation gain, plus any side trips and detours that catch my
interest.

I'm planning to navigate primarily using paper maps, with gps-assisted
navigation for the first and last miles (to/from lodging) in a typical day.
What can I say, I'm old fashioned.

## Timing
I'll be leaving in the next month or so. For safety reasons, my blog will
be some number of days behind my actual progress. If you want to get
closer-to-live email updates, shoot me an email or text and I'll add you to
the list! More info on tracking my progress below.

I'm planning on a pretty leisurely pace of around 50-60 miles per day, with
rest days built in. At that pace, I plan to be on the road for seven
weeks. I would not be surprised, though, if I hit my groove a few weeks in
and start chugging through more miles each day. Only time will tell.

I'm lucky enough to have a job lined up starting this summer, so I can
reasonably take seven weeks off to bike.

## Food + water + lodging
My plan is to carry 2-4 days of food and 1-3 days of water at any given
time. I'm not doing the hyper-dehydrated meal route or anything, just
energy-dense foods you can get from a grocery store. For water, I will have
a filter and/or purification tablets, but plan to use mostly tap water from
homes and libraries along the way.

Lodging-wise, I will be carrying camping gear and plan to camp most of the
way. Sites likely include [WarmShowers](warmshowers.org) (a reciprocal
camping/housing site for long-distance cyclists), campsites, and possibly
churchyards and community spaces. On rest days, I'm open to staying in a
hotel or airbnb of some sort, ideally with the ability to do laundry. Or I
might just do a few 5-10 mile days and camp as usual.

## Stay in touch!
Some options for keeping up with my progress:

  * Check this blog every few days! I'm aiming for roughly weekly posts.
      You know already how eloquent I am (not), but I'll try to have an
      anecdote or two and a decent photo. As I said above, my blog will be
      some number of days behind my actual progress.
  * Hop on my email list for up-to-date word from me about where I am and
      what's been fun. Reach out to me at [firstname].arvanitis@gmail.com
      or contact me in your usual way and I'll add you to the list! Again,
      aiming for roughly weekly, with a shorter bonus check-in some weeks.
  * If you know me well, I trust you, and you would like almost-daily texts
      with my location, get in touch and I can add you to my gps
      notification list.
  * If you know me well, I trust you, _and_ you want to help keep me
      updated on weather and road conditions when I don't have cell
      service, get in touch and we can talk!
