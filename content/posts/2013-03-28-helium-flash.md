Stars between around 0.5 and 2.5 solar masses happily ['burn'
hydrogen](@/posts/2013-03-07-fusion.md) for
most of their lives. Once one runs out of hydrogen, it suddenly isn't
producing enough energy in its core to support its outer layers, and the
star collapses under gravity. The first thing that happens here is that the
density increases, so the star starts fusing hydrogen in layers outside the
core, which causes the outer layers to expand outwards. The star becomes a
red giant, but its core and inner layers continue to collapse under
gravity. The two main forces that prevent any star from collapsing inward
are thermal pressure (fusion inside emits radiation and prevents nearby
layers from encroaching) and degeneracy pressure (a quantum effect - no two
fermions (like electrons or hydrogen atoms) can occupy the same quantum
state, so the star can't collapse any further than that). Since the core is
now fusing much less hydrogen than before, the thermal pressure is dwarfed
by degeneracy pressure. The pressure is high enough to initiate helium
fusion, which increases the temperature. But because the core is primarily
supported by degeneracy pressure, this increase in temperature does almost
nothing to expand (and thus cool) the helium-fusing portion of the star. So
the helium fusion becomes a runaway reaction in what's called the helium
flash. This phase of the star's life only ends when the temperature finally
rises enough to overwhelm degeneracy pressure. At this point, the star
expands and cools a bit. Helium continues to burn, but in a more regulated
manner, and thermal balance reigns once more.

Stars with less mass don't heat up enough to go through helium burning, and
instead become helium white dwarfs. Stars with more mass are able to start
helium burning before the core becomes degenerate, so there's no runaway
helium flash. These eventually become neutron stars and supernovae - a
topic for another day.
