Today, with the assistance of the lovely Sid, I led my first trip! It was a half-day paddle around Resurrection Bay, and I had just a blast. Our clients were awesome, wildlife was astonishingly plentiful, and it felt awesome to really hit my stride on interpretation and timing and group dynamics.

I definitely have some things to work on, and I got some fabulous feedback from the trip. I won't know until tomorrow whether I've "checked out" or not. But for now, I'm just so proud and happy to have led my first trip!

In any case, I'm up at around 6am tomorrow for a full-day Aialik trip, so ciao!
