Apart from the neutrinos from the Sun, we can also observe neutrinos from
high-energy cosmic events. The best example of this is supernova 1987A, a
stellar explosion in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby galaxy, whose
light reached us in February of 1987.

As we've seen, in the early stages of a supernova, the iron core's electron
degeneracy pressure isn't enough to oppose gravitational collapse, and
electron capture ensues, in which the reaction $p+e^-\rightarrow n+ \nu_e$
turns the core into an enormous atomic nucleus called a neutron star. This
produces a huge flux of neutrinos. And to make matters even more
interesting, as these neutrinos propagate through the incredibly dense
core, they lose energy, much of which is released in the form of
neutrino-antineutrino pairs. (At least, that's what I get from reading bits
and pieces of the literature on the subject.) The net result is an immense
flux of neutrinos heading away from the collapsing star. Outside the
extremely dense core, the neutrinos can happily propagate through just
about everything, whereas light from the ensuing explosion has to bounce
around for quite a while before escaping. As a result, the neutrinos leave
the immediate vicinity of the star long before the actual light, and carry
well over 95% of the collapse's total energy.

Luckily for astrophysicists, there were several neutrino detectors in
operation on February 23, 1987. These detected an enormous flux of
neutrinos for a short period of time. In fact, Kamiokande-II saw such high
detection rates that they were able to use more of their detector than
usual for detection, because the background was such a low fraction of
events compared to normal.* Just because I found this figure, I'm going to
inflict it on you as well. It's the original data from Kamiokande-II
showing the huge number of events. They detected 11 events in a matter of
minutes, as compared with just a couple each day under normal
circumstances. Another neutrino detector, IMB, near Lake Erie, detected 8
neutrinos at the same time.

Furthermore, these neutrinos were detected around three hours before the
light from the explosion reached Earth, which confirms once again how
awesome neutrinos are as astrophysical tools. It also allowed physicists to
place upper limits on the mass of the neutrino, since more massive
particles would have had to travel much slower than light, and would likely
have been overtaken by the explosion's light on the way to Earth.

\* The way that Kamiokande operates, as far as I can tell, is that it only
    uses the central portion of the water chamber. The outer layers are
    simply there to filter out background, like cosmic rays and radiation
    from detectors or other nearby objects. Only a small portion can be
    used for the real detection of neutrinos because of the incredibly low
    interaction rates. Any false positives would have a major impact on the
    resulting data.
