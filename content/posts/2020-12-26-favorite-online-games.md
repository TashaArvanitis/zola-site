I've been playing tons of amazing games with family and friends during this
time of plague. It's gotten hard to keep track of what's where! So I've
compiled my favorites.

EDIT: this outgrew a single blog post, so it's now located [here](/games).


NOTE: using things for free on the internet is all fun and games until it means game designers and programmers aren't getting fairly compensated for their work. I recommend:


1. Owning these games before playing them online â€“ this option is like bringing the physical game to a party. It means you're paying the designer a fair price. But it still doesn't thank the people who implement the game somewhere on a website.
2. Tip, donate, or buy a coffee for the web developers who put your favorite games online. Even just a \$5-10 contribution helps.
3. In addition to (1) and/or (2), send designers a thank you email! They'll certainly appreciate it.
