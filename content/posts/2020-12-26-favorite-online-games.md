I've been playing tons of amazing games with family and friends during this time of plague. It's gotten hard to keep track of what's where! So here's my favorites (so far). See below the list for advice on what game might be best for your situation.


NOTE: using things for free on the internet is all fun and games until it means game designers and programmers aren't getting fairly compensated for their work. I recommend:


1. Owning these games before playing them online â€“ this option is like bringing the physical game to a party. It means you're paying the designer a fair price. But it still doesn't thank the people who implement the game somewhere on a website.
2. Tip, donate, or buy a coffee for the web developers who put your favorite games online. Even just a \$5-10 contribution helps.
3. In addition to (1) and/or (2), send designers a thank you email! They'll certainly appreciate it.
