In general, I would advise against snow kayaking, as it's not a real thing. Really this is just a "hi! I'm still alive!" post, plus a funny riff on my upcoming kayak guiding work in Alaska (more on that soon). According to [weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/aprfc/Snow_Depth), Seward currently has around 20 inches of snow on the ground, so I thought it'd be best to start practicing now!
