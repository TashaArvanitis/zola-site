Over in [another post](@/posts/2021-02-07-printrbot.md), I've been working
on getting an old 3D printer up and running. It became clear by the end of
that post that I need to understand g-code better. So here's my attempt at
that. (These are effectively notes for myself, and if they help someone
else out, all the better.)

## What *is* g-code?
G-Code is, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code),
"the most widely used computer numerical control programming language".
That is, it's the assembly language of automated manufacturing – the basic
set of instructions that you can use to tell an automated lathe, CNC mill,
or 3D printer what to do.


## Some raw g-code to work with
For reference, here's the "starting gcode" in Cura (Manage Printers ->
Machine Settings)

```asm
G21 ;metric values
G90 ;absolute positioning
M82 ;set extruder to absolute mode
M106 ;start with the fan on for filament cooling
G28 X0 Y0 ;move X/Y to min endstops
G28 Z0 ;move Z to min endstops
G29 ;run auto bed leveling
G1 Z15.0 F9000 ;move the platform down 15mm
G92 E0 ;zero the extruded length
G1 F200 E10 ;extrude 10mm of feed stock
G92 E0 ;zero the extruded length again
G1 F9000
;Put printing message on LCD screen
M117 Printing...
```
Cura inserts the following before the starting code (apparently if you
include heating commands in your custom gcode, it may skip adding these
beforehand, but I haven't tested that):

```asm
;FLAVOR:Marlin
;TIME:191
;Filament used: 0.0893543m
;Layer height: 0.2
;MINX:42.45
;MINY:92.95
;MINZ:0.3
;MAXX:57.55
;MAXY:110.05
;MAXZ:8.3
;Generated with Cura_SteamEngine 4.8.0
M140 S60
M105
M190 S60
M104 S200
M105
M109 S200
M82 ;absolute extrusion mode
```

And here's what happens after that:

```asm
G92 E0
G92 E0
G1 F2700 E-0.7
;LAYER_COUNT:41
;LAYER:0
M107
G0 F3600 X45.411 Y93.329 Z0.3 <-- this sets the Z height for the 0th layer
;TYPE:SKIRT
G1 F2700 E0
G1 F1500 X45.997 Y93.128 E0.03091
G1 X46.604 Y93.004 E0.06182
G1 X47.124 Y92.961 E0.08785
; ... more G1/G0 commands with absolute coordinates
; E[xxx] means the cumulative extrusion length should reach [xxx] over the course of the move.
; F[xxx] means the "Feed rate" (move speed) shouldn't exceed xxx (units??)
; ... end of 0th layer
;MESH:NONMESH
G0 F600 X51.401 Y98.919 Z0.5 ; <-- this is what moves us up to 0.5mm in Z
G0 F3600 X52.08 Y104.58
G0 X52.15 Y104.65
;TIME_ELAPSED:24.380026
;LAYER:1
M106 S255
;TYPE:WALL-INNER
;MESH:settlement.STL
G1 F1816.3 X47.85 Y104.65 E18.08754
```

And at the end of the run:

```asm
;MESH:NONMESH
G0 F600 X50.143 Y98.147 Z8.3
G0 F7200 X50.074 Y104.95
G0 X50.074 Y105.05
;TIME_ELAPSED:189.910031
;LAYER:40
;TYPE:WALL-OUTER
;MESH:settlement.STL
G1 F600 X49.926 Y105.05 E89.02557
G1 X49.925 Y97.95 E89.26172
G1 X50.074 Y97.95 E89.26668
G1 X50.074 Y105.05 E89.35434
G0 F7200 X49.926 Y105.05
G0 X49.926 Y104.998
;TIME_ELAPSED:191.375966
G1 F2700 E88.65434
M140 S0
M107
M104 S0 ;extruder heater off
M140 S0 ;heated bed heater off (if you have it)
G91 ;relative positioning
G1 E-1 F300  ;retract the filament a bit before lifting the nozzle, to release some of the pressure
G1 Z+0.5 E-5 X-20 Y-20 F9000 ;move Z up a bit and retract filament even
more
G28 X0 Y0 ;move X/Y to min endstops, so the head is out of the way
M84 ;steppers off
G90 ;absolute positioning
M82 ;absolute extrusion mode
M104 S0
;End of Gcode
```

I have neither the expertise nor the time to do a line-by-line breakdown of
what all this does.

I believe that what I want is to move the platform up or the extruder down
by a bit. The advice seems to be moving in 0.2mm increments to avoid
damaging the build plate. So here we go!
