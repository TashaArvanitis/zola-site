This week I had the pleasure of shadowing my first adaptive ski lesson. It was a fun one, with a student who made noticeable progress throughout the lesson. Our final run was in deep, fresh powder and our student crushed it.

Some things I learned:

- Learn what motivates a student! For this student, going fast and skiing in front were huge motivators, which Eric used throughout the lesson.
- When instructing while skiing, try to encourage various strategies. If one doesn't work two or three times in a row, abandon it and switch to something else. Once you find something that does work, stick with it! It becomes something like a mantra.
- For many folks on the spectrum, knowing "the plan" is important. At the beginning of the lesson, Eric went over the key skills he wanted the student to work on. Then, during each lift ride up, we figured out what run we'd use to practice those skills, while also balancing the student's desire to ski fast.

And of course, thanks to Eric and all the others at the NAC who made this happen.
