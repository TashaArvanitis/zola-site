Hi there world! If you can read this, then my WordPress install actually worked. Excuse me while I go celebrate by drinking designer orange juice and disconnecting from Stack Overflow for a bit.

<!-- more -->

I'm planning to write a little more about how I self-installed WordPress, but for now I'll just say that I'm running this site from a lovely [droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/compute/), and like most (all?) self-hosted WordPress sites, it's running on linux, apache, mysql, and php7. I've learned _a lot_ about this standard LAMP stack in the last few weeks, and it's been a heck of a ride.

## Questions left over after this post

- Is designer orange juice actually a thing?
- Is it possible to run Wordpress on anything other than LAMP? I'm guessing no.
