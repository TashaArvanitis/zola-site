I've discussed the [beginner ski progression](@/posts/2018-11-26-adaptive-ski-instructing.md) before. One of the hardest parts to teach is transitioning from wedge turns to partially-parallel turns. These are known as the wedge Christie. The idea is that a student is still using a wedge to control their speed as they point downhill, but is approaching parallel skis on the traverses. And it is _hard_ to teach. That's because we're asking students to control their skis independently for the first time. It can be a lot to keep track of.

#### Terminology

From teaching and watching others teach, terminology can be a big tripping point. We talk about the inside or outside ski, but with reference to which turn? What about uphill/downhill? Again, this changes from turn to turn. In this post, I'm going to use uphill and downhill. I find it easiest to keep track of. That's because at first, most of the movement towards parallel will happen on traverses rather than during the turn.

#### What is going on

Here are the rough mechanics when we transition from a wedge to parallel skis:

- Weight shifts to the downhill ski
- The uphill ski flattens out, which is a change from the strong inside edge in a wedge
- The uphill leg rotates to point in the direction of motion
- The whole body extends right before the turn and flexes during it
- In more advanced skiers, the uphill ski starts to take a turning role so that the student is turning with both skis rather than just one

As you can see, there's a lot going on. And with a lot of students, you really don't want to describe all this. Instead you want a one- or two-step instruction that will help their body do all these things without their realizing it.

#### Some teaching techniques

For weight shifting, games like the [reverse
airplane](@/posts/2018-11-27-ski-games.md) or basketball turns (dribble on the
downhill side, shoot on the turn) can help a student feel the weight shift.
Plus basketball turns can encourage flexion and extension throughout the turn.

For flattening the uphill ski, I like thumper turns. Basically as you turn, you
lift the uphill ski a few times and thump it down. It makes a satisfying noise,
and it forces the weight into the downhill ski. And as you shift it, the uphill
ski typically flattens out as well. Similarly, shuffle skis back and forth
during a turn â€“ it's astonishingly hard to do this and maintain a wedge!

For rotation of the leg, talk about moving the uphill big toe uphill. That's a
fine-motor skill, but you can also talk about the gross-motor "knee
flashlights" that you want to point in the direction of travel. In most
students this will naturally turn the whole uphill ski.

As mentioned before, basketball turns can contribute to flexion and extension.
Other games include jumping on the turn, inhale-driven turns, roller coaster
turns...

And of course, all of this can happen in the course of a single "follow the
leader" session, by adding a new dynamic or game every five or ten turns.

I should note: this barely scratches the surface of techniques for the wedge
Christie. Every student is different, and the heart of adaptive skiing is
adapting to the abilities of the student. Come on out to a lesson if you want
some more ideas!
