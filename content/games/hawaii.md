Okay, so Board Game Arena is confusing. Here's how to play a game:

1. Make an account (email, username)
2. Add the host as a friend
3. Create or join a game
    - to create: press "Play Now" (top left), then select "Simple Game"
        under Game Mode, select "Real Time" for speed (unless you want to
        play over the course of a week), choose "Friends" as who you want
        to play with. Then invite your friends to join you, wait 'till they
        do, and get cracking!
    - to join: wait for the host to invite you (you may need to accept
        their friend request first). A little popup will appear somewhere
        saying "xyz has invited you to play zyx" – click accept and you'll
        be in.

NOTE: In Hawaii, the game will let you buy something you cannot physically
place, but it won't let you un-buy it, which will mean you have to quit the
game. If in doubt, ask a friend if you'll be able to place a certain
tile/hut – better that than ending your game early!
